A 10.5 mile loop with a mixture of flowing singletrack and doubletrack punctuated with rock formations and natural springs hosts the 10th annual Lost Valley Luau. While the gravel/ doubletrack sections are fairly flat, the singletrack sections serve up flowing, serpentine goodness with high speed descents and stunning views of the valley.

Trail surface varies from dirt to rock throughout the trail, and drains very well, except in the flats of the lower creek bottom.

From the Highway 40/94 interchange: Take Highway 94 South approximately 1 mile on Right at the Mound.
